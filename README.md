# Crowdfunding_ETL
Overview:
For Project 2 (ETL Mini Project), we worked together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we extracted the data and uploaded as separate CSV files.
